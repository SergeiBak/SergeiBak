### Hello there üëã

Welcome to my GitHub Page! My name is Sergei, I also go by Serge. My passion for coding started one Middle School Summer when I attended a college Game Design Workshop at Sno-Isle, where I led a team of 4 into building a successful project that placed us into the top 3 despite being one of the youngest group of presenters there!

Since then, I have been actively pursuing my dream of becoming a Software Developer. I have spent my last two years studying at the [University of Washington](https://www.uwb.edu/), and will be graduating with my Bachelor's in [Computer Science & Software Engineering](https://www.uwb.edu/bscsse) this coming Spring! I have always been a diligent worker when it comes to all aspects of life, and am proud to say that I have just recently been awarded a Certifcate of High Scholarship for placing on the Annual Dean's List by nomination on behalf of the Honors Committee.
